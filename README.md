# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
This Election Audit Analysis was performed to help determine the winner of a local congressional election. Of the counties that participted and the candidates who were in the running, a popular vote winner needed to be determined as well as which county had the highest voter turnout.

#### Resources:
The election data was provided in an Excel spreadsheet titled election_results.csv, and the election winner, along with additional information, was determined using Python 3.10.1 in Visual Studio Code 1.63.2. 

#### Deliverables:
The Colorado Board of Elections has asked for the following information to provide a comprehensive outcome of the election audit:

1. Find the total number of votes that were cast in the election.
2. Find all of the counties that participated in the election.
3. Calculate the total number of votes cast in each county, as well as the percentage of total votes that were cast in that county.
4. Determine which county had the largest voter turnout.
5. Find all of the candidates that received votes in the election.
6. Calculcate the total number of votes each candidate received, as well as the percentage of total votes they received.
7. Determine the winning candidate based on popular vote and provide their vote count and vote percentage.

## Results
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- There were 3 counties that participated in the election: 
        1. Arapahoe
        2. Denver
        3. Jefferson
- The county results were as follows:
    - Arapahoe had 24,801 votes cast, which came out to 6.7% of the total votes.
    - Denver had 306,055 votes cast, which came out to 82.8% of the total votes.
    - Jefferson had 38,855 votes cast, which came out to 10.5% of the total votes.
    - From these results, it is clear that Denver had the largest voter turnout of all the counties.
- The candidates that received votes were: 
        1. Charles Casper Stockham
        2. Diana DeGette
        3. Raymond Anthony Doane.

- The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette who receied 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 total votes.
